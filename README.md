# JiMEditor
A Scenario editor for the Journeys in Middle Earth board game. The scenarios are playable in the companion playback app, [Your Journey](https://github.com/TrnsltLife/your-journey), forked from [GlowPuff's original project](https://github.com/GlowPuff/JiMEditor) with new tiles from [Celstra](https://github.com/Celstra/JiMEditor).

## Documentation
You can find documentation for the app [in GlowPuff's Wiki](https://github.com/GlowPuff/JiMEditor/wiki). Although it is somewhat out of date at this point, it should still get you started.
